I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Eastern Finland as part of the inverse problems research group. I currently work on inverse problems in functional and quantitative MRI.


Research Interests:
======

My general research interests lie in using techniques from mathematical optimization, numerical mathematics and probability theory/statistics in inverse problems, image processing and machine learning. In particular, the theory and application of regularization strategies and prior modeling.


Understanding regularization strategies and prior modeling
-------------------

Examples of recent work:
- Theory of constraints and sparsity-promoting regularization for linear inverse problems, and its applications to uncertainty quantification. ([Constraints](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=uCQwNJoAAAAJ&citation_for_view=uCQwNJoAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C), [Sparsity 1](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=uCQwNJoAAAAJ&citation_for_view=uCQwNJoAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC)[, 2](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=uCQwNJoAAAAJ&citation_for_view=uCQwNJoAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC))
- [One-bit compressed sensing with generative models (MSc thesis)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=uCQwNJoAAAAJ&citation_for_view=uCQwNJoAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C)



Applications and software
-------------------

Examples of recent applications:
- [Velocity-space tomography in plasma fusion](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=uCQwNJoAAAAJ&citation_for_view=uCQwNJoAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC)
- [Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) with partial data](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=uCQwNJoAAAAJ&citation_for_view=uCQwNJoAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC)

Examples of recent work including code:

Previous positions:
======
Until September 2025, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Technical University of Denmark as part of the [CUQI research project](https://sites.dtu.dk/cuqi) on Computational Uncertainty Quantification for Inverse Problems. I worked on the use of tools from mathematical optimization for modeling and sampling in Bayesian inverse problems.
