I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Technical University of Denmark as part of the [CUQI research project](https://sites.dtu.dk/cuqi) on Computational Uncertainty Quantification for Inverse Problems. I currently work on the use of tools from mathematical optimization for modeling and sampling in Bayesian inverse problems.

Research Interests:
======

My general research interests lie in using techniques from mathematical optimization, numerical mathematics and probability theory/statistics in inverse problems, image processing and machine learning. In particular, the theory and application of regularization strategies and prior modeling.


Understanding and developing regularization strategies and prior modeling
-------------------
<!-- Write a small description here
Well chosen regularization and priors has various benefits. It allows us to still obtain good reconstructions even if the amount of data is limited or the data is heavily corrupted. It also allows us to increase the efficiency of the reconstruction when combined with efficient. But designing these regularization and priors can be difficult, with there generally being a trade-off between the complexity of the information we try to promote and the efficiency of the algorithms.

Applications and software
-------------------
<!-- Write a small description here
In real-world applications, data is often limited and/or corrupted, whilst the size of the problems are very large. They therefore greatly benefit of well designed regularization and priors to make most of the data.

Many applied scientists are not familiar with the mathematical and/or computatational details of these regularization strategies and prior models. Therefore, it is very important to make these tools available to them by means of easy-to-use software.

Uncertainty quantification methodologies
-------------------
<!-- Write a small description here
Different regularization strategies and prior models will result in different reconstructions; each can be equally valid for the purpose at hand. It is beneficial to study how certain we are of our reconstruction in order to make good conclusions and well-informed decisions. The field of uncertainty quantification provides us with tools to study the uncertainty of our reconstructions. However, there are many different approaches to uncertainty quantification, each of which comes with different guarantees and limitations.
