I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Technical University of Denmark as part of the [CUQI research project](https://sites.dtu.dk/cuqi) on Computational Uncertainty Quantification for Inverse Problems. I currently work on the use of tools from mathematical optimization for modeling and sampling in Bayesian inverse problems.

Research Interests:
======

My general research interest lie in using techniques from mathematical optimization, numerical mathematics and probability theory/statistics in inverse problems, image processing and machine learning. In particular, the theory and application of regularization strategies and prior modeling.

Some of my recent research include:
- Theory of sparsity-promoting regularization and its applications to uncertainty quantification.
- Bayesian and frequentist approaches to uncertainty quantification for inverse problems.
- Regularization and prior modelling for imaging.
